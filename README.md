This thing is very early in development and everything is subject to change,
but here's a quick elevator pitch of my current vision.

Flamegrower is a 2D platformer revolving around physically simulated vines. In
a solarpunk-inspired eco-futuristic world threatened by an invasive alien plant
species, you control an android gardener tasked with killing it with fire. Use
the vines that grow out of your arms to move around grappling-hook style and
connect objects to create puzzle-solving contraptions. Then bring a flame to it
and watch the fire take it all away.

The physics is entirely custom-made, implemented as part of my
[Starframe](https://github.com/m0lentum/starframe) engine which I am
developing alongside this game. My foolhardy plan is to make everything myself,
including art and music, and release it all open source.

I'll flesh out this readme with pictures and such when there's more to show. In
the meantime, there may or may not be something about this near the top of [my
Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/molentum_).
