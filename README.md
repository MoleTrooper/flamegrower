This thing is very early in development and everything is subject to change,
but here's a quick elevator pitch of my current vision.

Flamegrower is a 2D platformer revolving around physically simulated vines. In
a solarpunk-inspired eco-futuristic world threatened by an invasive alien plant
species, you control a bioandroid tasked with killing it with fire. Use the
vines that grow out of your arms to move around grappling-hook style and
connect objects to create puzzle-solving contraptions. Then set it all aflame
and watch those alien weeds wither away to ash.

The physics is entirely custom-made, implemented as part of my
[Starframe](https://github.com/MoleTrooper/starframe) engine which I am
developing alongside this game. My foolhardy plan is to make everything myself,
including art and music, and release it all open source.

I'll flesh out this readme with pictures, compilation instructions and such
when there's more to show. In the meantime, there's probably something about
this near the top of [my Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/moletrooper).
